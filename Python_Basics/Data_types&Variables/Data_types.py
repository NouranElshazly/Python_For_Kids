# In this section, we will discuss data types and variables. First, there are some rules for naming variables: 

# 1. A variable cannot start with a number.
# 2. Spaces are not allowed in variable names; for example, "first name" would result in an error.
# 3. Instead, you can write it as "firstname" without any spaces or use an underscore, like "first_name."

# We use variables to store different data types.

#there are a different data type : 1- integer (int)
number = 9 #===> number is a variable with store an integer data (9) 
print(number) #===> we use print function to print anything for user
#if we want to know any variable type we use :
print(type(number))
#2- float 
number2=9.1 #===> any dicimal number is float 
print(number2)
print(type(number2))

#3- string  (anything  " between double cotuchin ")
first_name = "Nouran"
Last_name = "Elshazly"
print(first_name)
print(Last_name)
print(type(first_name))
print(type(Last_name))
#4- boolean => true or false 
x=9>10  #=> x return false so it is an boolean variable
print (x) #=> false
